This extension helps you quickly view the history of a file in VS Code.  
If you already have other Git extensions installed (e.g., **GitLens**, **Git History**), searches may not use the **Git File History** package directly.  

### How to Use

1. Open the file you want to track in **VS Code**.  
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + P** to open the Command Palette.  
3. Type and select **Git File History** (or **Show File History**).  

### What Youâ€™ll See

The extension will display the fileâ€™s history, including:  
- Commit message  
- Branch  
- Date  
- Changes made
